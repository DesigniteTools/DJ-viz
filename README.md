# Smells Viz

## Description

The project aims to develop a web application for visualizing and analyzing code smells detected by the "Designite Java" software. "Designite Java" identifies various types of code smells within Java projects and generates CSV files containing detailed information about these smells. The web application provides a user-friendly interface to upload the folder path containing these CSV files and dynamically visualize the data extracted from them.

## Features

1. **CSV Data Visualization:**

   - Allows users to upload the folder path containing CSV files generated by "Designite Java".
   - Reads the CSV files and visualizes the data to provide insights into different categories of code smells.

2. **Bar Graph Representation:**

   - Displays a bar graph showing the total number of smells in each smell category.

3. **Pie Chart Analysis:**

   - Provides pie charts for each smell category, illustrating the distribution and types of smells within them.

4. **Metric Selection and Scatter Plot:**

   - Offers a selection of metrics through radio buttons.
   - Based on the selected metric, displays a scatter plot representing the relationship between different metrics for deeper analysis.

5. **Treemap Visualization:**

   - Presents a treemap visualization where the size of rectangles corresponds to the lines of code (LOC) of different code entities.
   - Includes a slider to set the range of metrics to be displayed on the treemap, allowing users to focus on specific metric values.
